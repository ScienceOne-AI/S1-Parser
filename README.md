**S1-Parser** is a highly efficient multimodal text parsing tool designed to enable accurate and efficient parsing of complex documents. Instead of relying solely on static fine-tuning or single-stage optimization, it employs a strategy of first Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) then Reinforcement Learning (RL), effectively fine-tuning the model on critical aspects such as formula syntax correctness, symbol integrity, and structural rationality—balancing parsing precision and efficiency across diverse document types.

## ⚙️ Environment Setup (Recommended)

We recommend using **Python 3.10** and **PyTorch ≥ 2.7**.  

Install the environment:
```bash
# Recommend Python 3.10.18
git clone https://github.com/ScienceOne-AI/S1-Parser.git
cd S1-Parser
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## 🏋️ Training

S1-Parser training proceeds in **two stages** with different designs:

```bash
# Stage 1: Execute the Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) to acquire fundamental LaTeX OCR.
bash scripts/run_train_ocr_sft_model.sh

# Stage 2: Execute the GRPO training to optimize LaTeX formula syntax, symbol and structure.
bash scripts/run_train_ocr_grpo_model.sh

```

---

Make sure to configure your model paths and data in `script/run_train_ocr_*.sh`.
